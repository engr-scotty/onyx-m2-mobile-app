# Onyx M2 Mobile App

## Notes

After installing, don't forget to:
  - Give location permission. The app won't find the M2 BLE device without this. You might not to force close the app for this to take effect.
  - Remove "battery optimization", as it'll ironically kill the battery. (I believe this is a known BLE issue, and you should do this for the Tesla app too.) 
  
## TODO

Needs a real README.
